During this period, the university introduced remote working policies and campus access restrictions to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, there was a significant decrease in Faculty and Staff together with External and Other memberships; meanwhile, undergraduate student memberships only decreased by 14% in AY20-21 as most students were allowed to stay on-campus.<br><br>From March 2020 to June 2022, access to the Fitness Center, Women's Only-Gym, Indoor and Outdoor Tracks, and the 50m Pool required advanced booking on FABS' Capacity Management portal. Thus, those who wished to use these facilities must have a FABS membership. <br><br>AY21-22 and AY22-23 saw a remarkable rebounce in the number of memberships that exceeded pre-COVID figures across all demographic categories. Notably, the number of External and Other memberships (consisting of guests and other external communities) almost quadrupled in AY21-22, following the relaxation of most COVID restrictions for indoor places.",

    "description": "This dataset visualizes food waste in the East Dining Hall (D2). The amount of food waste is measured by weighing the <i>plate-waste</i> (leftover food from the customers) with calibrated scales operated by the Dining service provider. Past data visualizations, such as the calendar-style monthly food waste counter at the entrance of D2, have brought about awareness among the community. Not being constrained by the crowded space of the Dining Hall, this visualization allows for a more detailed and nuanced break-down of the dataset into timeline, monthly, by-meal statistics.<br><br>The data provided here is the absolute amount of food waste. The number of transactions per meal or the number of customers who eat in D2 at each meal still need to be considered to shed light on the food waste variability over time. We are currently working with the service provider to get this data. In more detail, we aim to collect aggregate, anonymized numbers of transactions to calculate per-transaction waste.",
